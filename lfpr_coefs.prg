'This program creates a matrix of estimated coefficients for all LFPR equations: 69 equations for males and 84 equations for females.
'The program produces two matrixes that are used in other programs (LFPR decomposition, for example):
'1. A string vector "LFPRgroups"(153 elements) serves as an ORDERED list of all the primary demographic groups for which we have LFPR equations; for each group name, the position in this vector indicates the row of the coefficicnt matrix correspond to that equation. Exaple: group F2529MANC6 corresponds to row #79. 
'2. A matrix named "LFPRbetas"(153 rows by 63 columns) that containes the superset of all estimated coefficicnts in LFPR equations; these are arranged in a particular order so as to contain the full superset of variables uised in ALL LFPR equations. This means that many coefficicnts are zeros. 

'LFPRbetas matrix and LFPRgroups string vector can be used in other programs that need to compute LFPRs from estimated equations. 
'I created them for use use in the LFPR decomposition process, but other programs that use LFPR estimated equations can use them as well. 

'Right now the LFPRbetas matrix is filled manually (I copied the coefficicnts from the existing equations), but in the future a code should to be written to update it automatically by plugging in the estimarted coefficicnts from EViews into approproate locations in the matrix. I will write a separete descrsiption of what the appropriate location is for every equation and coefficicnt.

' **** New method for including individual addafctors. This applies to TR2020 and later. 
' Starting with TR2020 we now have individual addfactors for all SYOA groups 55 to 74. This, the *2nd* element in each row vector corresponding to thos ages should be equal to 1.
